# Hi, I’m Sabeer

I’m an MCA graduate who enjoys building **AI-first applications**, especially around **LLMs, applied machine learning, and computer vision**.  
Most of my projects focus on experimenting with **AI behavior**, prompt design, and practical AI use cases.  
Web technologies are used mainly as a lightweight interface to interact with AI systems.

## What I Focus On

- Generative AI and LLM-based systems  
- Prompt engineering and behavior control  
- Applied machine learning fundamentals  
- Computer vision for real-world problems
